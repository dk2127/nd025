### Project Motivation
#### The renting of AirBnB has become very common since it provides very competitive alternative to the hotels at most tourist places. With so many options   #### available on the AirBnB platform, as a tourist I am motivated to find to find answers to the following questions, with the Seattle AirBnB data:

  1) What are the most popular neighbourhoods in Seattle of AirBnB listings?
  2) What are the important factors that determine price per night?
  3) What are the busy periods for the Seattle AirBnBs?Â¶
  4) What are the per night average price during that period?
